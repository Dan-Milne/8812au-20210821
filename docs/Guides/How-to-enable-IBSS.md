# How to enable IBSS

### What is IBSS?

IBSS, or Independent Basic Service Set, is a type of wireless networking commonly used in situations where there's no centralized access point, like in ad-hoc or peer-to-peer networks. It's like when you and your friends connect your devices directly to each other without needing a Wi-Fi router.

> Note: IBSS does not work on Android natively.
